## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Fork this repository**  
2. **Set up GitHub Actions** (already configured for you)  
3. **Watch the magic happen** as your profile stays active!  

Your GitHub activity will remain **consistent and lively**, so you can focus on what really matters—without worrying about arbitrary metrics.
